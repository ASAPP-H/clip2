Unilateral ( left ) venous USG : Focused exam without evidence of DVT . If more complete exam for superficial thrombosis is desired , a dedicated exam can be obtained in the future . Brief Hospital Course : 61 year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer was admitted with cholangitis culminating in septic shock , now s/p biliary drainage procedure , improving . . # Cholangitis : Patient presented with fever and RUQ that was concerning for cholangitis . She was immediately started in IVF and antibiotics ( Vanc/Zosyn Day 1 [ **2149-5-6** ] ) . Since prior therapy with Unasyn failed Zosyn was chosen . The following day her WBC almost doubled ( 11 -- > 22 ) and her bilirubin was trending up ( 5.4 -- > 5.9 ) . An [ **Year ( 4 digits ) ** ] was planned to be done the same day , while waiting a repeat MRI was done to further assess her liver metastasis . The report came as new masses in the liver concerning for abscesses or cancer in the liver that were new from prior MRI 2 weeks prior as well as 2.5 cm ductal dilation ( See report for details ) . Patient became tachycardic and did not respond to 1.5 L NS . Minutes later patient required central line placement , arterial line and intubation prior to [ **Year ( 4 digits ) ** ] . In the [ **Year ( 4 digits ) ** ] pus was drained from the biliary duct . The plastic stent was removed and new metal stent was placed . She was transfered to the ICU , due to pressor and ventilator requirements . Both were stopped ( levophed and mechanical ventilation ) on day 3 of ICU stay . Antibiotics were continued and she improved . On [ **2149-5-11** ] she was transfered to the oncology floor , where she tolerated regular diet and her pain was controlled . Vancomycin was stopped . Upon discharge her bilirubin was 2.8 and trending down . Follow up with oncology was arranged and warning signs and symptoms were explained . She was discharged with home VNA and a left midline to complete a 14-day of IV Zosyn . . # Pancreatic cancer : With possible metastatic disease in the liver . MRI findings equivacal for abscess vs MRI . She will need follow up MRI . . # LUE swelling : concerning for DVT while in the ICU and before placing midline . DVT was ruled out with USG/doppler .
